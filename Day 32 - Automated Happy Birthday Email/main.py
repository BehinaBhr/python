##################### Extra Hard Starting Project ######################

# 1. Update the birthdays.csv

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv

# 3. If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.

##################### Hard Starting Project ######################

# 1. Update the birthdays.csv with your friends & family's details.
# HINT: Make sure one of the entries matches today's date for testing purposes.

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Only the month and day matter.
# HINT 2: You could create a dictionary from birthdays.csv that looks like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (month, day): data_row
# }
# HINT 3: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
# if (today_month, today_day) in birthdays_dict:

# 3. If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
# HINT: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
# HINT: Gmail(smtp.gmail.com), Yahoo(smtp.mail.yahoo.com), Hotmail(smtp.live.com), Outlook(smtp-mail.outlook.com)

##################### Normal Starting Project ######################

# 1. Update the birthdays.csv with your friends & family's details.
# HINT: Make sure one of the entries matches today's date for testing purposes. e.g.
# name,email,year,month,day
# YourName,your_own@email.com,today_year,today_month,today_day

# 2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Create a tuple from today's month and day using datetime. e.g.
# today = (today_month, today_day)

# HINT 2: Use pandas to read the birthdays.csv

# HINT 3: Use dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary from birthday.csv that is formated like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (birthday_month, birthday_day): data_row
# }
# Dictionary comprehension template for pandas DataFrame looks like this:
# new_dict = {new_key: new_value for (index, data_row) in data.iterrows()}
# e.g. if the birthdays.csv looked like this:
# name,email,year,month,day
# Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# Then the birthdays_dict should look like this:
# birthdays_dict = {
#     (12, 24): Angela,angela@email.com,1995,12,24
# }

# HINT 4: Then you could compare and see if today's month/day tuple matches one of the keys in birthday_dict like this:
# if (today_month, today_day) in birthdays_dict:

# 3. If there is a match, pick a random letter (letter_1.txt/letter_2.txt/letter_3.txt) from letter_templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
# HINT 1: Think about the relative file path to open each letter.
# HINT 2: Use the random module to get a number between 1-3 to pick a randome letter.
# HINT 3: Use the replace() method to replace [NAME] with the actual name. https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_replace.asp

# 4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
# HINT 1: Gmail(smtp.gmail.com), Yahoo(smtp.mail.yahoo.com), Hotmail(smtp.live.com), Outlook(smtp-mail.outlook.com)
# HINT 2: Remember to call .starttls()
# HINT 3: Remember to login to your email service with email/password. Make sure your security setting is set to allow less secure apps.
# HINT 4: The message should have the Subject: Happy Birthday then after \n\n The Message Body.
